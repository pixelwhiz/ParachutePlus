# 🪂 ParachutePlus

**ParachutePlus** is a Minecraft PocketMine plugin that allows players to use parachutes for a fun and safe descent. The plugin introduces two custom items: Parachute and AutoParachute, providing unique gameplay mechanics such as deploying a parachute and automatically activating it when falling.

## Steps to Use:
1. **Give Parachute**: Use the `/parachuteplus give <player name>` command to give a parachute to a player.
2. **Deploy Parachute**: Right-click with the parachute item in hand to deploy it. The player will be mounted on a custom chicken entity, which will glide the player safely downwards.
3. **Auto Parachute**: Once deployed, the parachute item transforms into an `AutoParachute`, which automatically activates upon falling and is removed when the player lands.
